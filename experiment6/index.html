				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>We wanted to create a parody of children's educational programs similar to: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNBTciYa4Ng"> "Between the Lions"</a>.

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>We used collision detection and grammatical logic to order the words once collided. The new string would be fed to a text-to-speech library. 
				   The loop will pause; read out the new word to the user; move one of the collided bubbles away; and then continue. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> Originally, we weren’t too sure if this experiment was within the suggested constraints. It also does not venture too in-depth into the topics related; however, after reassurance from Sai, we pressed on.
				<br>
				<br> The concept stems from old-school educational programs that teach kids to read, but with the weird inhuman text-to-speech interpreting the random words. One aspect that could have been improved is how often the program interprets words like: cnn or tcn. It would usually just abbreviate them to: C.N.N. or T.C.N, which wasn’t what we were looking for, but it would require far more tweaking of the actual API. We would have also liked to have created a visual effect similar to Wes's Meta Balls, with its fluorescent lighting and ASCII text shape. 
				<br>
				<br> Overall, while the weekend was hectic, we were able to work together and find time to collaborate. For the most part, we were on a call and used liveshare via VS Code. For working on an experiment with a partner, things went pretty smoothly.
