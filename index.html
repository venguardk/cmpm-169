					<h2>Keven Paw</h2>
					<p>I am a senior CS:GD major. I enjoy all sorts of games both digital and analogue, such as RPG's, card games, etc. I have experience with most C languages and python. 
						While I don't consider myself an artist, I do have experience with 2D and 3D, and above all I like to animate. Above are hopefully my most recent animations. </p>
